# VBA-challenge

in this file I used VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data. 
i created a loop that generate the outputs of the following:

1- The ticker symbol
2-Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
3-The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
4-The total stock volume of the stock.

This project started by creating headers for columns needed, defining variables and setting rows and columns where it starts.

We looped throw the rows to check names changing so we can calculate ticket counter.
Conditional formating were used to set background color when it comes to values larger than 0.

Percentage change and total change were calculated and shown inside the code. 

using If condition, we were able to find Greatest increase, Greatest Decrease and greates total volume.

After finding results, we formated the cells to be percentage and scientific. 

and we made this loops to all WS included in this project.
